#WT2 WebTop

##Disclaimer
At the beginning of the project we developed with love, made every bit of code object-oriented, reusable and beautiful. However, with the progression of the project and the growing uselessness we lost the desire to develop with love, and the code started to get ugly... some functions may work while some may not; we don't want to hear nothing from this WebTop again... such an useless piece of code.
